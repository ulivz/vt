# Introduction

## Motivation

[Next Vue's documentation](https://staging.vuejs.org/) is very cool, which is built by `@vue/theme` and [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) —— A next-generation SSG for Vue ecosystem, but currently VitePress is still in early stage and there is no plugin system.

I made this theme to combine eXperience of `@vue/theme` and [current huge VuePress ecosystem](https://github.com/vuepress/awesome-vuepress/), also introducing some built-in features like **full-text search**, **i18n** etc.

## Features

- [**Compatibility**](./migration.md): fully compatible with [VuePress's Default Theme](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html).
- [**Full-text search**](./search.md): No server dependencies, distinguishing locales.
- [Dark Mode](./dark-mode.md)
- [TypeScript Support](./configuration.md)
- [Homepage](./home.md)
- [API Page](./api-page.md)
- i18n, Code Copy, TOC, etc.
- ...
